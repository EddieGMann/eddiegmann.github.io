                        <li>Create temporary queries to find information</li>
                        <li>For some reason, the "fall" semester keeps changing to spring.  When that happens, go into the _be version, find TblList_Terms and change the first entry to "Fall"</li>
                        <li>Once, all of the VB disappeared.  Probably because it is not designed for multiple users at once.  When that happens, find all the buttons and replace the VB code from the saved file.  The title should tell you where to find the button.</li>
                        <li>Every so often, the tuition rates will be raised.  When they are, the form that is sent out will be incorrect.  Go into the queries that connect the data for the "Payment Forms" (Duke and NIH) and change it to the correct amount.  The math formula should be correct then.</li>
                        <li>From time to time, you will be asked to find information about the NIH.  If you want, you can do multiple queries to get the location, or use the Excel formula with the information you get from the easier query. I am loathe to create new permanent queries because of the exaggerated way this database was created</li>
                        <li>For the Research Project payment to show up on the form, the class status must be "Registered".  If the status is "InProgress" it needs to be changed back.</li>
                        <li>If someone gets a new computer, they must have a drive set up for (L:).  Put everything that goes before education, starting with \\ and remember to have private on the end.  I cannot say more here for security reasons, but IT will know.  Yes, it is a stupid solution, but it works because it was stupid the way it was set up.</li>

                                <li>The threat about $100 dollar no-show fee is hollow.  Life happens.  Sometimes people forget they sign-up, sometimes a nervous presentor does a bad job in the first of a two-part seminar and no one wants to come to the second.  No need to ask for fund code.  In fact, a presentor asked us to not include it.</li>

                                <li>FCIEMAS has two doors, both of which are generally locked.  Contact or find someone to open.  They will ask if you tried both doors.  Try not to glare.</li>
                                <li>French Science 4233 has a laptop AV hookup in the corner.  If you can find a clicker to use, being it along.</li>

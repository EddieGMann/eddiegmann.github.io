<p>About Me <br>
I'm 38 years old and a proud graduate of NC State University, where I earned my degree in Education. Currently, I work at Duke University in the Department of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics, where I focus on learning technology.
Though I don’t necessarily cook, I’m a big fan of reading cookbooks and exploring new recipes for fun. When I’m not working, you’ll often find me immersed in a good urban fantasy novel or unwinding with the peaceful rhythms of Stardew Valley.
I live in beautiful North Carolina, where I enjoy the balance of work, hobbies, and my love for learning and discovery.</p>

            </div>
            <div>
                <p>I'm 38 years old and a proud graduate of NC State University, where I earned my degree in Education. Currently, I work at Duke University in the Department of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics, where I focus on learning technology.
                Though I don’t necessarily cook, I’m a big fan of reading cookbooks and exploring new recipes for fun. When I’m not working, you’ll often find me immersed in a good urban fantasy novel or unwinding with the peaceful rhythms of Stardew Valley.
                I live in beautiful North Carolina, where I enjoy the balance of work, hobbies, and my love for learning and discovery.</p>

                <p>I began using computers at an early age.  My family had a computer with Windows 3.1, which meant all games were accessed using DOS.  I also remember using Hyperstudio and green-screen computers at school</p>

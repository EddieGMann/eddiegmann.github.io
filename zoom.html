    <ul>
        <li>Setting Zoom up for seminars, classes, meetings and interviews on classroom systems</li>
        <ul>
            <li>In 214 choose "Video Call" whereas in 10089 choose "Zoom" from the home screen.  All other rooms will need to have the meeting run from a laptop.  Preferably, not your own.</li>
            <li> Type in the number to dial (i.e. #########@zoomcrc.com</li>
            <li>Press Dial</li>
            <ul>
                <li>If prompted, enter the passcode on the DMTF screen followed by #</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Enter 1,2(moderately fast) on the DMTF screen to unmute the microphones.  Even if the room is already unmuted, enter it to make sure it is habit </li>
            <li>On the panel, on the right, there is a column to send content.  Choose the correct system (laptop/desktop/document camera, etc) to send content to the zoom.  If you press the content and it automatically does not work, you need to change the share permissions for the room.  If the content brings up a blank black screen for the zoom, change the content to something else, then change it back to the correct content or stop send and re-send content.</li>

            </ul>
            <li>Host key is for Matthew Franco.  Get your own at <a href="https://duke.zoom.us/">Duke Zoom</a>-> Sign In -> Profile -> Scroll down until you see Host Key, press the closed eye to view))</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Please review the classroom panel documentation (214)(10089) to set the correct outputs for the presentation.</li>
        <li>If you have trouble getting content from a laptop to show, go physically check to see if the person actually plugged the HDMI into the laptop.  Frequently, they plug the HDMI into an adaptor and then leave the adaptor far from the laptop.</li>
        <li>Here is some documentation that can be sent to those that set <a href = "images/settingupzoomatduke.docx" target = "_blank" download>Zoom</a> up for regular meetings</li>

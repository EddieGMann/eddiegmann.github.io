    <h1> The Learning Technology Program Coordinator is responsible for the following:</h1>
</div>
<div>
    <ul>
        <li>CRTP Classrom 214</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Set up AV for presentations.  On the home screen, choose video call for meetings with zoom, AV presentation for everything else.  Audio call is no longer used.</li>
                   <ul>
                       <li>No Ceiling mics.  Remind speakers that if they are not behind the podium they need to use a handheld or lapel mic.  If there is a zoom, participants at room desks will need to press and hold button to use seat mic.</li>
                   </ul>
                <li><a href = "zoom.html"> Basic Zoom Call Set-up</a></li>
                <li>Remember that in the AV room control panel the top row is live camera & bottom is camera being adjusted.  You can see both, the zoom audience cannot.</li>
                <li>All conversations in the AV room are very audible in the classroom.  If you are taking a different zoom meeting or working on something else, close the door.</li>
                <li>If projector does not turn on, manually check in the adjacent room.  Unplug & plug back in.</li>
                <li>Remember to route things to where they need to go, including the correct output to Panopto.  If something is not displaying content, check that the proper source has been routed to it.  All output routes are listed on the panel under advanced routing.  Do not forget to send content to zoom.  Click the correct output under send content.  If it immediately goes back to blank, then the room does not have permission to send and the zoom must be adjusted.</li>
                <li>I like to set up zoom on lectern computers so that the presenter can see the chat and respond themselves.</li>
            </ul>
    </ul>
    <ul> 
        <li>MB Classroom 10089</li>
             <ul>
                <li>Set up AV for presentations/interviews/classes. There are several presentation options.  I usually choose AV presentation or zoom.  You can choose video call option for zoom if you would like.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Ceiling mics:  The entire room is a microphone, but sound quality is better behind podium or with a lapel mic.  May need to remind participants that all audio in room is caught by mics for zoom.</li>
                    </ul>
                        <li>The zoom in this room has issues.  If the system locks up, reset the box in the AV room (Press the ominous red button)  If that does not solve it, unplug everything from wall.</li>
                        <li>I find that putting the password in slowly helps </li>
                        <li>I also find that not having a password on the zoom is the best.  When routing to the password stage, the system locks-up.  My attempts to relay this information have been ignored.</li>
                        <li>If there is a hard reset, you will likely need to get the ladder from the closet next to the classroom.  (The door as you turn the corner)  Unplug and plug in each projector.  You know you will need to if the projector light is yellow instead of green/blue.</li>
                <li>There is a glass board and special markers.  Course directors never throw out dead markers so once a month go find weak markers and dispose of them.</li>
                <li>The student tables will move.  This may cause the electrical hookups to be unplugged.  Reset tables and check connections (plugs underneath each table) before reporting they are dead dead. </li>
            </ul>
    </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>PhD Classroom 11025</li>
                   <ul>
                       <li> Set up AV presentations for special occasions.  PhD level courses do not get AV assistance unless it is requested.  Class are not generally recorded.</li>
                        <li>The entire room is a microphone.  May need to remind participants that all audio in room is caught by mics for zoom.</li>
                   </ul>
                <li>There is no AV room.  For zoom, outputs will need to be selected on the zoom computer, which will be the presenters laptop</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>Extra Classroom 11110</li>
                    <ul>
                    <li> Set up AV for presentations.  You will be sent a calendar invite if this room is booked and requires AV.</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The entire room is a microphone.  May need to remind participants that all audio in room is caught by mics for zoom.  Offer the handheld mic to the presentor.</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>There is no AV room.  For zoom, outputs will need to be selected on the zoom computer, which will be the presenters laptop.</li>
                    <li>The door at the back can block the camera.  For presentations where food is served, it is generally served in the next room.  People will move the door in front of the camera as they wait in line.  Tell presentor to check before officially starting the meeting.</li>

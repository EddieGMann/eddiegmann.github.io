    <h1> The Learning Technology Program Coordinator is responsible for the following:</h1>
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li>CRTP Classrom 214</li>
            <ul>
                <li>No Ceiling mics.  Remind speakers that if they are not behind the podium they need to use a handheld or lapel mic.  If there is a zoom, participants at room desks will need to press and hold button to use seat mic.</li>
                <li>Set up AV for presentations.  On the home screen, choose video call for meetings with zoom, AV presentation for everything else.  Audio call is no longer used.</li>
                <li><a href = "zoom.html"> Basic Zoom Call Set-up</a></li>
                <li>Remember that the top row is live camera & bottom is camera being adjusted.  You can see both, the zoom audience cannot.</li>
                <li>All conversations in the AV room are very audible in the classroom.  If you are taking a different zoom meeting or working on something else, close the door.</li>
                <li>If projector does not turn on, manually check in the adjacent room.  Unplug & plug back in.</li>
                <li>Remember to route things to where they need to go, including the correct output to Panopto.  All output routes are listed on the panel under advanced routing.  Do not forget to send content to zoom.  Click the correct output under send content.  If it immediately goes back to blank, then the room does not have permission to send and the zoom must be adjusted.</li>
                <li>I like to set up zoom on lectern computers so that the presenter can see the chat and respond themselves.</li>

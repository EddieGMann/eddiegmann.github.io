                    <li>Get a list of names.  Change the format back to excel from whatever was given.  Import data. Done</li>
                    <li>For people with preferred names (Not dead names) Put the preferred name large, legal first name (once again, never use dead name) small and then last name small</li>
                    <li>For name tents remember to make first/preferred name BIG.  Big enough to be seen from the front of 10089.  Around 130 fontsize</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Classroom supplies to start the year.  Contact whoever is in charge of ordering for the department.  Markers, nametags/tents, board cleaning supplies.</li>
            <li>Zoom
                <ul class = "normalduties">
                    <li>Make sure to automatically record the zoom.  Use panopto to record as well.</li>
                    <li>You might make it, someone else might.  Make sure Kendall knows who is making the official orientation Zoom</li>
                </ul>

            <li>Student Photo Grid

                    <li><a href = "photogridgenerator.py" target = "_blank" download>Photogrid Generator Program</a></li>
                        <li>Download, do not copy, download files from the photographer's website.  Name them lastname, firstname.  Zip them up.  Drop Zip into the generator GUI. Then choose the students to go into the grid.  Put a title at the top and make sure all looks okay.  This could also be used if course instructors ask for a photogrid for their specific class.  You will need to make MB, PhD and CBB.  For PhD and CBB, put the new photos into the grid generator, then paste into old photogrid.  You will also need to delete graduates from throught the previous academic year.  It is not a pretty process.</li>
